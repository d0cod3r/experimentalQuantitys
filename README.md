# experimentalQuantities

This is a python package to handle quantities from physical experiments.
Those are numbers with a statistical deviation, a systematical
uncertainty and a unit.

It supports basic arithmetics, many other mathematical functions and has
a special enviroment to handle large collections with similar uncertainties
and units.
